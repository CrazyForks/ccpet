# Story 1.6: A New Beginning

## Status
âœ… Completed

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** my pet to automatically reset when it completely dies,  
**so that** I can restart the nurturing experience from scratch.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When pet's energy drops to exactly 0, automatically clear all token statistics
2. Clear totalLifetimeTokens, totalTokensConsumed, and accumulatedTokens to 0
3. Pet starts fresh - new tokens consumed will rebuild the pet from the beginning

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement automatic death reset functionality (AC: 1,2,3)
  - [x] Modify resetToInitialState() method to clear ALL token statistics
  - [x] Reset totalLifetimeTokens to 0 (not preserve as before)
  - [x] Reset totalTokensConsumed and accumulatedTokens to 0
  - [x] Reset energy to INITIAL_ENERGY and expression to HAPPY
  - [x] Reset lastFeedTime and lastDecayTime to current time
- [x] Remove VSCode command integration (outdated approach)
  - [x] Remove package.json contribution for VSCode commands
  - [x] Remove VSCode extension activation code
  - [x] Remove VSCode-specific command handling
- [x] Update automatic death detection (AC: 1)
  - [x] Ensure isDead() method correctly detects energy === 0
  - [x] Automatic reset happens when energy drops to 0
- [x] Update comprehensive testing (All ACs)
  - [x] Unit test updated resetToInitialState() behavior
  - [x] Test automatic death reset functionality
  - [x] Remove VSCode command-related tests
  - [x] Test that all token statistics are cleared on death

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.7 have established the complete pet lifecycle with energy management (Story 1.2), expression changes (Story 1.5), time decay (Story 1.4), token feeding (Story 1.3), and state persistence (Story 1.7). Story 1.6 completes the cycle by enabling automatic pet rebirth when death occurs.

### Project Structure
Based on architecture, implement in these exact locations:
- `src/core/Pet.ts` - Update resetToInitialState() method to clear ALL token statistics [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#business-logic-layer]

### Component Implementation Standards
Follow existing CLI architecture established in Stories 1.1-1.7 [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]:

**Pet Class Enhancement (`src/core/Pet.ts`):**
- Must update resetToInitialState() public method to clear ALL token statistics including totalLifetimeTokens
- Must use PET_CONFIG constants for initial values (INITIAL_ENERGY, HAPPY_EXPRESSION)
- Must maintain isDead() public method that returns boolean based on energy === 0
- Must call existing _updateExpression() and _notify() methods after reset
- Must follow error handling patterns with try-catch blocks
- Must maintain observer pattern notifications

**Automatic Death Reset:**
- Death occurs when energy drops to exactly 0
- All token statistics (totalLifetimeTokens, totalTokensConsumed, accumulatedTokens) are cleared
- Pet effectively "dies" and user must start over by consuming new tokens
- No manual intervention required - death reset is automatic

### Error Handling Considerations
- Proper error messages for failed state reset operations
- State consistency validation after reset operation
- Handle edge cases during automatic death reset

### Testing
Unit tests must cover:
- resetToInitialState() clears ALL token statistics to 0
- isDead() accurately detects death state (energy === 0)
- Automatic death reset functionality when energy drops to 0
- State persistence integration after reset
- Error handling for invalid states
