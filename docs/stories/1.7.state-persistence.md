# Story 1.7: State Persistence

## Status
✅ Completed

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** my pet's state to be saved and restored when I close and reopen the IDE,  
**so that** I get a continuous, uninterrupted experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Pet's current energy value is saved to local storage after each change
2. When extension starts, it loads the last energy value from local storage
3. Extension startup calculates time elapsed since last closure and applies appropriate energy decay rules

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create persistent storage service (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create PetStorage class for file-based state persistence
  - [x] Implement saveState() method to write pet state to JSON file
  - [x] Implement loadState() method to read pet state from JSON file
  - [x] Use ~/.claude-pet/pet-state.json as storage location
  - [x] Handle file creation and directory setup automatically
- [x] Integrate storage with Pet state management (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Add saveState() calls after energy changes in Pet class
  - [x] Load saved state during extension initialization
  - [x] Handle missing or corrupted state files gracefully
  - [x] Preserve lastFeedTime and lastDecayTime for time calculations
- [x] Implement time-based state restoration (AC: 3)
  - [x] Calculate elapsed time since last session
  - [x] Apply energy decay based on time elapsed using existing applyTimeDecay()
  - [x] Ensure state consistency between sessions
- [x] Add error handling and graceful degradation (All ACs)
  - [x] Handle file system errors gracefully
  - [x] Provide default state when storage fails
  - [x] Log storage operations for debugging

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.4 established the Pet class with energy management and time decay functionality. Story 1.4 specifically added lastDecayTime tracking which is essential for accurate time-based calculations across sessions.

### Project Structure
Based on architecture, implement in these exact locations:
- `src/services/PetStorage.ts` - Persistent storage service implementation [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#service-layer]
- `src/ccpet.ts` - Integration with CLI extension lifecycle [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#cli-entry-point]
- `src/core/Pet.ts` - Integration with existing state management [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#business-logic-layer]

### Component Implementation Standards
Follow existing CLI architecture established in Stories 1.1-1.4 [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]:

**PetStorage Service (`src/services/PetStorage.ts`):**
- Must implement file-based storage using JSON format
- Must store in user home directory under .claude-pet folder
- Must handle directory creation and file permissions
- Must provide both synchronous and error-handled operations
- Must validate loaded state against IPetState interface
- Must follow error handling patterns with try-catch blocks

**Extension Integration (`src/ccpet.ts`):**
- Must load saved state during ClaudeCodeStatusLine constructor
- Must save state after each pet state change via saveState() method
- Must apply time decay immediately after loading saved state
- Must handle initialization with and without existing saved state
- Must preserve existing CLI workflow and status display functionality

**Pet Class Integration:**
- Must accept loaded state in constructor while maintaining existing interface
- Must continue using existing applyTimeDecay() method for session restoration
- Must preserve observer pattern for state change notifications
- Must maintain existing energy management and expression update logic

### Data Models
Pet state JSON structure:
```typescript
interface IPetState {
  energy: number;
  expression: string;
  lastFeedTime: Date;
  totalTokensConsumed: number;
  accumulatedTokens: number;
  lastDecayTime?: Date;
}
```

### Testing
Unit tests must cover:
- State serialization and deserialization
- File system error handling and graceful degradation
- Time-based restoration with various elapsed periods
- Integration with existing Pet class functionality
- CLI workflow with persistence enabled

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
claude-sonnet-4-20250514

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ PetStorage service implemented with robust file-based persistence
- ✅ JSON storage format chosen for human readability and debugging
- ✅ Home directory storage location (~/.claude-pet/) for user isolation
- ✅ Graceful error handling for file system operations
- ✅ Integration with extension lifecycle in ClaudeCodeStatusLine constructor
- ✅ Automatic state saving after Pet state changes via saveState() method
- ✅ Time-based restoration using existing applyTimeDecay() functionality
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing Pet class interface
- ✅ All acceptance criteria verified through manual testing and integration tests

### File List
Files created/modified during implementation:
- `src/services/PetStorage.ts` - Complete persistence service implementation
- `src/ccpet.ts` - Integrated storage loading/saving in ClaudeCodeStatusLine
- `src/core/Pet.ts` - Added support for loaded state in constructor
- `src/services/__tests__/PetStorage.test.ts` - Comprehensive unit tests for storage
- `src/__tests__/ccpet.test.ts` - Integration tests with persistence
- `src/__tests__/integration/PetIntegration.test.ts` - End-to-end persistence testing

## QA Results
✅ All acceptance criteria verified:
- AC1: Pet state automatically saved to ~/.claude-pet/pet-state.json after each energy change
- AC2: Extension loads saved state on startup, falling back to default state if file missing
- AC3: Time decay correctly applied based on elapsed time since last session
- State persistence works across multiple CLI executions
- Error handling gracefully manages file system issues
- Performance impact minimal with JSON serialization
- Cross-platform compatibility verified (Windows, macOS, Linux)
