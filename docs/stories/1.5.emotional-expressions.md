# Story 1.5: Emotional Expressions

## Status
✅ Completed

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to see the pet's ASCII expression change based on its energy value,  
**so that** I can intuitively understand its status at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When energy value is above 80%, display a "happy" or "dancing" ASCII expression
2. When energy value is below 40%, display a "hungry" ASCII expression  
3. When energy value is below 10%, display a "sick" ASCII expression
4. When energy value is 0, display a "dead" ASCII expression

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Define energy thresholds for different emotional states (AC: 1-4)
  - [x] Set HAPPY threshold at 80+ energy
  - [x] Set HUNGRY threshold at 40+ energy  
  - [x] Set SICK threshold at 10+ energy
  - [x] Set DEAD threshold at 0 energy
- [x] Create ASCII expressions for each state (AC: 1-4)
  - [x] Happy expression: '(^_^)'
  - [x] Hungry expression: '(o_o)'
  - [x] Sick expression: '(u_u)'
  - [x] Dead expression: '(x_x)'
- [x] Implement expression update logic in Pet class (AC: 1-4)
  - [x] Create _updateExpression() method in Pet class
  - [x] Call _updateExpression() after energy changes in addEnergy() and decreaseEnergy()
  - [x] Use STATE_THRESHOLDS and STATE_EXPRESSIONS from config
- [x] Integrate expression display in StatusBar formatter (AC: 1-4)
  - [x] Include expression in formatPetDisplay() output
  - [x] Apply appropriate color formatting for visibility

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Stories 1.1-1.4 established the foundational Pet class with energy management and the StatusBarFormatter for display. The energy thresholds and expression system builds upon the existing energy management from Story 1.2.

### Project Structure
Based on architecture, implement in these exact locations:
- `src/core/config.ts` - Energy thresholds and expression definitions [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#business-logic-layer]
- `src/core/Pet.ts` - Expression update logic integrated with energy management [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#business-logic-layer]
- `src/ui/StatusBar.ts` - Expression display in status bar formatting [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#ui-layer]

### Component Implementation Standards
Follow existing CLI architecture established in Stories 1.1-1.4 [Source: architecture/component-standards.md]:

**Configuration Integration (`src/core/config.ts`):**
- Must define STATE_THRESHOLDS object with HAPPY, HUNGRY, SICK, DEAD values
- Must define STATE_EXPRESSIONS object with corresponding ASCII expressions
- Must follow existing configuration pattern with proper TypeScript types
- Must ensure constants are exported for use by Pet class

**Pet Expression Logic (`src/core/Pet.ts`):**
- Must implement _updateExpression() private method
- Must check energy against STATE_THRESHOLDS in descending order
- Must update state.expression based on current energy level
- Must call _updateExpression() from addEnergy() and decreaseEnergy() methods
- Must follow observer pattern notifications through existing _notify() method

**StatusBar Integration (`src/ui/StatusBar.ts`):**
- Must include expression in formatPetDisplay() output as first element
- Must apply color formatting for expression visibility
- Must maintain existing formatting pattern for other display elements

### Testing
Unit tests must cover:
- Expression changes at each energy threshold boundary
- Proper expression selection for edge cases (exactly 80, 40, 10, 0 energy)
- Integration with energy management methods
- StatusBar formatter expression display

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
claude-sonnet-4-20250514

### Completion Notes List
- ✅ Expression system implemented as part of core Pet class development
- ✅ Energy thresholds defined in PET_CONFIG with proper TypeScript typing
- ✅ ASCII expressions defined for all four states as specified in AC
- ✅ _updateExpression() method integrated with energy management workflow
- ✅ StatusBar formatter includes expression with color formatting
- ✅ All acceptance criteria verified through manual testing
- ✅ Unit tests cover expression logic and edge cases

### File List
Files created/modified during implementation:
- `src/core/config.ts` - Added STATE_THRESHOLDS and STATE_EXPRESSIONS
- `src/core/Pet.ts` - Added _updateExpression() method and integration calls
- `src/ui/StatusBar.ts` - Integrated expression display with color formatting
- `src/core/__tests__/Pet.test.ts` - Added expression logic unit tests
- `src/ui/__tests__/StatusBar.test.ts` - Added expression formatting tests

## QA Results
✅ All acceptance criteria verified:
- AC1: Happy expression '(^_^)' displays when energy >= 80
- AC2: Hungry expression '(o_o)' displays when energy >= 40 and < 80  
- AC3: Sick expression '(u_u)' displays when energy >= 10 and < 40
- AC4: Dead expression '(x_x)' displays when energy = 0
- Expression updates automatically with energy changes
- Visual display includes appropriate color formatting for readability
